*** Setup
See [[https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/setup/container][Official document]] to setup local toolchain. I recommend to use container approach.

*** make
When building shield such as *orbit-one* , run command in container under ~/workspace/zmk-config~:

#+begin_src sh
  $ build-local.sh
#+end_src
